# WHALE
Social Sensing environment with Experience Sampling capabilities.

## Components
* [Android App](app-android): The app that records sensor data. Needs to be installed on participant's devices
* [Backend](backend): The backend that allows for data storage. Deployed on a server.

> [!NOTE]  
> See the component's respective READMEs for more information.

### Interaction Bubble & NotificationTriggers
We want to track if an interaction is happening and relying on sensors alone would not be sufficient. We use the following approach:
- a sticky and unobtrusive widget flows around the screen based on conditions defined as a [NotificationTrigger](app-android/README.md)
  - the widget shows questions from a questionnaire (see [Experience Sampling](#experience-sampling))
- rules defined in the displayed questionnaire determine if a new NotificationTrigger is added, or another full questionnaire is shown
- this setup allows for conditional EMAs based on what the participant answered in a previous EMA

### Experience Sampling
We want to trigger an experience sampling form when specific events happen:
- rule from interaction bubble evaluates to show a new full questionnaire (triggered by `event` trigger)
- in a specific interval
  - every day at the same time (triggered by `periodic` trigger)
  - EMA: across the day, with a minimum time between samples (triggered by `random_ema` trigger)
- once, for example for the takeout questionnaire at the end of a study (triggered by `one_time` trigger)
- for displaying the questionnaire inside the floating widget (triggered by `ema_floating_widget_notification` trigger)

A sampling could include the following:
- content separated in steps (title, position)
  - visual/content
    - (rich) text
  - input
    - text
    - radio
    - checkbox
    - Likert scale
    - slider
    - affect grid
    - time/duration
    - circumplex (affect grid)
    - social network
      - entry: possibility to list people in sampling
      - rating: possibility to answer questions about a person
    - button list (only available for floating widget)
  - link to external questionnaire (is embedded in questionnaire to instruct the participant)

```mermaid

erDiagram
    Study
    Questionnaire {
        bool enabled
        string name
        number version
        list rules
    }
    Trigger {
        string eventType
        bool enabled
        object configuration
    }
    Element {
        string type
        number step
        number position
        object configuration
    }
    Questionnaire ||--|{ Trigger : "has"
    Questionnaire ||--o{ Study : "belongs to"
    Element ||--o{ Questionnaire : "belongs to"
```

After updating any element of the questionnaire, its version needs to be updated. The app will only update the questionnaire if the version is higher than the one currently cached.

### When it samples
- after unlocking: for one minute
- in the background: ever five minutes for one minute

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Sample after Unlock" as Sample_Unlock
    state "Sample Periodically" as Sample_Periodic
    
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Sample_Unlock: After Unlock
    Idle --> Sample_Periodic: After 5 minutes since last periodic
    Sample_Unlock --> Idle: After 1 minute
    Sample_Periodic --> Sample_Unlock: After unlock while sampling
    Sample_Periodic --> Idle: After 1 minute
```

### Study Configuration
The platform's backend allows multiple studies to be configured and run in parallel, while each participant can only take part in one study at a time.
Configuration can be done via the [backend's API](backend/api.yaml) or directly on the database.

A study's configuration consists of:
- Name
- Enrolment key (which participants need to enter to join the study, unique across all studies)
- Maximum number of participants `maxEnrolments`, -1 for unlimited participants
- Duration in days `durationDays`
- Experimental Group allocation strategy `allocationStrategy`, only `sequential` is supported for now
- **Experimental Groups**
  - Name
  - Order
  - **Phases**
    - Starting day
    - Duration in days
    - Configuration parameters
      - Interaction widget display mode (in time buckets, every time, disabled)

    }
    Enrolment {
        int id
        int studyId
        string participantId
        int studyExperimentalGroupId
        timestamp enrolledAt
    }
    ExperimentalGroup {
        int id
        int studyId
        string internalName
        int order
    }
    ExperimentalGroupPhase {
        int experimentalGroupId
        int fromDay
        int durationDays
        string interactionWidgetDisplayMode
    }
