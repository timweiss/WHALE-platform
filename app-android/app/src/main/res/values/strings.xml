    <string name="onboarding_permissions_hint">Our WHALE research app collects data for 13 days that is not based on self-reported information, but on information from sensors in your smartphone. This includes, for example, ambient noise or how often you communicate with others via apps and/or phone calls. WHALE does not store ambient noise, but merely categorizes it (e.g., “speech,” “music,” “dog barking”) and then deletes it.&lt;br/&gt;WHALE does not record which messages you post or view on social media, &lt;b&gt;but&lt;/b&gt; merely measures &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you have used this social media platform. Phone calls are not recorded and phone numbers are not recognized, &lt;b&gt;but&lt;/b&gt; it is merely registered &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you have made a call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This smartphone data can provide important additional information about your everyday environment for the study. For example, this data helps us understand the context in which you answered the questionnaires without having to ask you specifically about it.&lt;br/&gt;A detailed list of the types of data collected can be found in the privacy policy and consent form you received when you registered for the study.</string>

    <!-- Permission names and descriptions -->
    <string name="permission_wake_lock_name">Keep app active in background 1</string>
    <string name="permission_wake_lock_desc">This is technically necessary to prevent your smartphone from automatically closing the WHALE app and to ensure that information from your smartphone\'s sensors can be recorded continuously.</string>

    <string name="permission_record_audio_name">Categorize ambient sounds</string>
    <string name="permission_record_audio_desc">Uses the microphone to make short audio recordings that are converted into a category within the app (e.g., “speech,” “music,” “dog barking,” “street noise”).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The audio recording itself will be deleted. This means that no audio recordings will be sent to our server. For more detailed information on how we process your audio recordings in a privacy-friendly manner, please refer to the privacy policy and consent form you received when you registered for the study.&lt;/i&gt;</string>

    <string name="permission_access_wifi_name">Wi-Fi status</string>
    <string name="permission_access_wifi_desc">Detects which Wi-Fi network you are logged into and which Wi-Fi networks are in your vicinity. However, we do not store the name of the network, but rather an encrypted version that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the name.</string>

    <string name="permission_receive_boot_name">Autostart</string>
    <string name="permission_receive_boot_desc">Automatically starts WHALE after a device restart</string>

    <string name="permission_fine_location_name">Location tracking</string>
    <string name="permission_fine_location_desc">This permission is required by the system because the app detects your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth status, which could potentially reveal your location. However, since the app does not store any names (see above), but rather an encrypted version, it is not possible to determine your location. We do not store any location data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Select Allow always&lt;/i&gt;</string>

    <string name="permission_background_location_name">Background location</string>
    <string name="permission_background_location_desc">This permission is required by the system so that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth status can be detected even when you do not have the app open. The app does not record your location in the background, but rather the encrypted names (see above).</string>

    <string name="permission_bluetooth_scan_name">Bluetooth scan</string>
    <string name="permission_bluetooth_scan_desc">Detects which devices in your vicinity have Bluetooth enabled. However, we do not store the name of the device, but rather an encrypted version that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the name.</string>

    <string name="permission_notification_listener_desc">Detects when notifications are received from which app&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: If your smartphone does not allow notification access, you will be redirected to the settings. Search for "Apps" and select the \'WHALE\' app under "Apps," scroll to "Allow restricted settings" and enable it. You can then grant permission in the app. Don\'t worry, you can trust us.
